Wikipedia and Wikivoyager scraping
----------------------------------

As with the module above, humans were quite clever in exploring the Wikipedia and Wikivoyager APIs using information extracted from Brazilian city data sources. The API, unlike the raw HTML page, returns the information well separated and makes the search for the information of interest much easier.
